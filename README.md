# VertiPrint Standalone Website

This is a lightweight, standalone website (no Shopify/WooCommerce).

## How to run locally
1. Unzip the folder
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

## How to host
- Any static host works (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, cPanel hosting, Hostinger, etc.)
- Upload the folder contents and ensure `index.html` is in the root.

## Update before launch
- Replace phone number in `index.html` (search for `04xx xxx xxx`)
- Confirm your contact email in the quote form (`data-to="info@vertiprint.com.au"`)
- Replace gallery images with real job photos as you complete projects
- Update service area text

## Contact form
The form uses a mailto flow (opens the user's email client). 
If you want a server-side form later, you can plug in:
- Formspree
- Netlify Forms
- A simple PHP mail script
